            <p>
                Biomedical Engineering graduate currently in the process of earning a certificate in Full Stack
                Development from the University of Texas at Austin. Developing skills in JavaScript, jQuery, React,
                and Node.js.
            </p>

            <p>
                I demonstrated client and server-side JavaScript skills in a recent group project where I worked in a
                team of four to develop a RESTful web application which allows homeowners to communicate with trick-or-treaters 
                about what types of candy they plan on handing out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Excited to leverage skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build
                better experiences on the web.
            </p>

            <p>
